# Appium Android Testing Project

## Overview

This project contains automated test scripts written in Java for testing Android application using the Appium framework. The tests are designed to run on real Android devices or emulators.

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have the following software installed:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 22
- Android Studio
- Appium Server
- Android 14 SDK and Emulator or Real Android Device
- Maven

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using Maven.
3. Connect a real Android device or start an Android emulator.
4. Install the apk file from "src/test/resources/Android-MyDemoAppRN.1.3.0.build-244.apk" onto your device.
5. Run the tests using whichever IDE of your choice. 
(Note: if you're using a real Android device, you will need to modify my code slightly as I'm testing this on an Android emulator.)
